"If search engine optimization, security concerns and user device specifications are
NOT a priority for you, and your focus is primarily on delivering dynamic interactivity
to the user, then client-side rendering (CSR) with technologies like ReactJS can be a
suitable choice.
A use case where this approach is applicable is in the B2B domain. In such cases, the
target audience is specific and known, eliminating the need to optimize SEO since the
product is not intended for a wide public audience.
This allows you to prioritize developing interactive features and functionalities
without dedicating significant resources to SEO optimization."
